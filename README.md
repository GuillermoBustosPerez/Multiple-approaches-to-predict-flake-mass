## README

The data and code present in this repository are part of the article
“Multiple approaches to predict flake mass” and intended for reviewers.
Data and code have been processed in compliance with reproducibility
standards for machine learning (Heil et al., 2021).

If the article is accepted for publication data and code will be publish
in the general-purpose open-access repository Zenodo along with making
it a public repository at GitHub.

## Structure of the repository

This repository contains the following folders and files:

-   Data (folder): contains data employed in the present research. Two
    files are available: a *.csv* and a *.RData*  
-   Hyperparameter grid search results (folder): contains two *.RData*
    files belonging to results from hyperparameter grid search of Random
    Forest model and Artificial Neural Net (ANN).  
-   Models (folder): containing the three models trained to estimate
    flake mass (Multiple Linear Regression, ANN and Random Forest). ANN
    and Random Forest have been trained with the optimal combination of
    hyperparamters.  
-   Complete Script.md: markdown version of the present research which
    contains all code and output generated in the present research. All
    summary statistics, tables, graphs and models can be generated with
    code and data present in the markdown.
