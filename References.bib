	abstract = {The familiar debate concerning Middle Paleolithic variability has opposed stylistic vs functional explanations based on the assumption that tool types and assemblage groups represent discrete, invariant entities. Middle Paleolithic variability, however, actually occurs continuously. Further, recent research shows that raw-material constraints and different degrees of artifact-reduction intensity constitue more basic and observable factors of variability than function and style. Thus, much of the variability in these assemblage appears to have been caused by toolmaking and tool-rejuvenation processes and/or by differential occupation intensity induced by environmental circumstance. The correct interpretations of these Middle Paleolithic assemblages must therefor consider these factors, as well as interrogation stylistic drift, function and diachronic change.},

In the absence of refits, the final state of the abandoned piece is the only remain that archaeologists have for the study of lithic reduction. The establishment of experimentally tested indexes providing strong correlations between estimated and real reduction are needed. In our work, we propose a new procedure for estimate reduction percentage. In this proposal, data are obtained from high resolution three-dimensional (3D) scans and manual measurements are avoided. The experimental test has been realized using distally retouched tools, the less suitable tools for reduction studies. The correlation levels obtained between the measured data and the estimated data increase substantially the original published from manual measurement, reaching a r2 value of 0.81 and a correlation of 0.9. The main contribution of the proposed method is the very high correlation obtained in the volume estimation (r2=0.89 and r=0.94) using the 3D-based measurements. The 3D models of the unretouched and retouched flakes used in this work are free to use and accessible through an online repository.},

	abstract = {Retouched artifacts are one of the most common elements of Middle Paleolithic lithic assemblages. Resharpening of the edges by retouch is integral to key concepts of lithic technology and patterns of site occupation dynamics. This has led to the development of indexes that quantify retouch among artifacts, allowing comparisons according to raw material type, distance to raw material source, archaeological levels, and other factors. Several methods have been proposed for measuring the edge consumed by retouch on each artifact. These indexes are usually scaled, ranging from zero to one or from zero to 100. However, few indexes measure retouch on a nonlimited scale. Here we present a new index that combines height of retouch and length of retouched edge to obtain proxies of volume lost. Advantages and limitations of the index are experimentally explored through three patterns of retouch and then applied to two different levels of Esquilleu Cave. Results show how a two-pronged index that considers consumed edge and total of volume lost by retouch can deliver insights into resharpening strategies among Middle Paleolithic groups.},

	abstract = {The use of 3D scanning to measure platform size is remarkably accurate and precise and has been used to estimate reduction intensity in lithic assemblages. While using 3D scans to measure lithic artefacts remains best practice in archaeology, the use of 3D scanning technology is seldom possible in real-world archaeological scenarios. Time constraints, budgetary constraints, large sample sizes, remote ﬁeldwork locations, unreliable access to electricity and unsuitable raw material types can render 3D scanning unfeasible. In such scenarios, platform size is typically estimated by multiplying calliper measurements of platform width and thickness, forming a rectangular approximation of the platform. As few platforms resemble rectangles, we ﬁnd that this method of platform measurement approximately doubles true platform size and is neither accurate nor precise. To remedy this overestimation, this paper introduces and tests the Geometric Approximations of Platforms ({GAP}) method, where simple 2D shapes (triangle, rhombus, trapezoid and ellipse) are employed in favour of the currently used rectangular approximations. Compared with platform width and thickness measurements, the {GAP} method is an equally simple and easily applied method that signiﬁcantly increases both the accuracy and precision of platform measurements, being statistically indistinguishable from 3D scanned platform area values. Moreover, we offer a means by which platform width and thickness values can be converted to be used in conjunction with those obtained from the {GAP} method, meaning that inter-site comparisons with previously analysed assemblages would not be hindered for those employing the {GAP} method.},

	abstract = {Stone tools were knapped, not built. This truism means that tools were reduced from larger pieces in the production process. But many tools were further reduced in use, to repair damage or as edges dulled. Reduction reduced size (trivially), but also changed the proportions among tools’ elements or dimensions. Such allometric variation (change in proportion as a function of change in size) is useful to estimate the degree of reduction that tools experienced. Reduction itself is a measure of curation, a theoretical concept of great interest in lithic studies and Paleolithic archaeology. To determine the reduction that archaeological tools experienced, we must compare their size and proportions at first use to the same properties at discard that we directly measure. By now many size estimates can be made from discarded tools. Some are experimentally tested but few are validated using direct ethnoarchaeological controls. We validate two allometric reduction measuresdratios of plan area to thickness and of an estimate of original to discarded volumedagainst direct measures of use and reduction in ethnographic Gamo hidescrapers from Ethiopia},

However, this important quantity may be related to elementary properties of tool classes such as size and weight, properties which are themselves directly measurable. Ethnographic data on ceramic vessels, in which use life is related to such properties, is described and analyzed. Using !Kung San and Ingalik data, a similar analysis is performed for a variety of nonceramic tools and objects, although few of the stone-tool classes common to archaeological assemblages are included. There, use life is related most strongly to manufacturing cost and curation rate, an archaeological measure of which is proposed. Neither is an elementary property, but they can be estimated accurately for many tool classes. These results are noteworthy but not definitive, and they underscore the continued value of museum ethnographic collections and ethnoarchaeological research.},

Using multivariate regression of 3D platform surface area and external platform angle we improve the accuracy of predictions of original flake mass. We propose a method for studying reduction intensity on retouched flakes, based on comparing predictions of the initial mass of the flake with measurements of the mass following retouching to estimate the amount of mass removed through retouching. We name this approach the Initial-/Terminal-Mass Comparison, or {ITMC}. Our experiments demonstrate that the capacity of the 3D platform scans to predict flake mass, and by implication the capacity of the {ITMC} to estimate mass loss, rivals or exceeds the capacity demonstrated for existing reduction measures.},

	shorttitle = {Why Levallois? A Morphometric Comparison of Experimental ‘Preferential’ Levallois Flakes versus Debitage Flakes},
	abstract = {Middle Palaeolithic stone artefacts referred to as ‘Levallois’ have caused considerable debate regarding issues of technological predetermination, cognition and linguistic capacities in extinct hominins. Their association with both Neanderthals and early modern humans has, in particular, fuelled such debate. Yet, controversy exists regarding the extent of ‘predetermination’ and ‘standardization’ in so-called ‘preferential Levallois flakes’ ({PLFs}). Using an experimental and morphometric approach, we assess the degree of standardization in {PLFs} compared to the flakes produced during their manufacture. {PLFs} possess specific properties that unite them robustly as a group or ‘category’ of flake. The properties that do so, relate most strongly to relative flake thicknesses across their surface area. {PLFs} also exhibit significantly less variability than the flakes generated during their production. Again, this is most evident in flake thickness variables. A further aim of our study was to assess whether the particular {PLF} attributes identified during our analyses can be related to current knowledge regarding flake functionality and utility. {PLFs} are standardized in such a manner that they may be considered ‘predetermined’ with regard to a specific set of properties that distinguishes them statistically from a majority of other flakes. Moreover, their attributes can be linked to factors that, based on current knowledge, are desirable features in flake tools (e.g. durability, capacity for retouch, and reduction of torque). As such, our results support the hypothesis that the lengthy, multi-phase, and hierarchically organized process of Levallois reduction was a deliberate, engineered strategy orientated toward specific goals. In turn, our results support suggestions that Levallois knapping relied on a cognitive capacity for long-term working memory. This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that cognitive distinctions between later Pleistocene hominins such as the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans were not as sharp as some scholars have previously suggested.},

	abstract = {Blank size and form represent one of the main sources of variation in lithic assemblages. They reflect economic properties of blanks and factors such as efficiency and use life. These properties require reliable measures of size, namely edge length and surface area. These measures, however, are not easily captured with calipers. Most attempts to quantify these features employ estimates; however, the efficacy of these estimations for measuring critical features such as blank surface area and edge length has never been properly evaluated. In addition, these parameters are even more difficult to acquire for retouched implements as their original size and hence indication of their previous utility have been lost. It has been suggested, in controlled experimental conditions, that two platform variables, platform thickness and exterior platform angle, are crucial in determining blank size and shape meaning that knappers can control the interaction between size and efficiency by selecting specific core angles and controlling where fracture is initiated. The robustness of these models has rarely been tested and confirmed in context other than controlled experiments. In this paper, we evaluate which currently employed caliper measurement methods result in the highest accuracy of size estimations of blanks, and we evaluate how platform variables can be used to indirectly infer aspects of size on retouched artifacts. Furthermore, we investigate measures of different platform management strategies that control the shape and size of artifacts. To investigate these questions, we created an experimental lithic assemblage, we digitized images to calculate 2D surface area and edge length, which are used as a point of comparison for the caliper measurements and additional analyses. The analysis of aspects of size determinations and the utility of blanks contributes to our understanding of the technological strategies of prehistoric knappers and what economic decisions they made during process of blank production.},

	title = {Discoid flaking method: conception and technological variability},
	series = {{BAR} International Series},
	abstract = {During the last decade, many scholars have progressively produced new data concerning the various methods employed in production of lithic implements. The corpus has allowed to detail the different flaking concepts and at same time to describe their specific singularities as well as their variability. In most of the studies focused on lithic technology, variability of methods implicit in the discoid concept has been storically negletted. Very frequently, an attribution to this flaking method has been produced in accordance to its classical meaning, in denying its diversity and impoverishing its interpretation. With the aim to disentangle this situation, we have tried to consider over many Middle Palaeolihic cases in Western Europe where discoid technology has been documented, by taking into account data in literature as well as new results provided from the study of archaeological sites in North-Eastern Iberian Peninsule (Cave 120, Roca dels Bous rockshelter, open-air site of Mediona I). We have tried to integrate information of this lithic assemblages within a unique flaking concept, seeking its identification features and precising its idiosyncrasy. This concept is materialized by a unique structure with a strong stability in its volumetric conception, nothwistanding a certain flexibility of its rules, that allow to develop different modalities of core management, always oriented towards the same technological conception. The preference of one method rather than others maybe explained in quantitative terms (production intensification) and by reference to the constrictive circumstances due to the original core shape. In spite of this diversity of applicable methods, a great uniformity exists in the predetermination criteria that manage the technical aims to be satisfied. These criteria are very homogeneous, at least by comparison with the criteria developed for other flaking methods.},

Variable selection for model training was carried out by using best subset selection, which evaluates all possible combinations of variables. Evaluation of the model was performed by computing common machine learning statistics along with estimated percentage error. Results make it possible to determine the best variables and estimate their relationships with ﬂake mass.

At the two studied sites, there is coexistence between expedient knapping systems and more complex techniques such as the Levallois method. Furthermore, cores are heavily exhausted, showing a pattern that cannot be explained by the absence or scarcity of raw material. This technical pattern can be traced across several Mousterian assemblages in the South-eastern Pyrenees, suggesting technocognitive continuity in the Middle Palaeolithic during the Upper Pleistocene, in which changes in lithic reduction patterns are not evident. In this paper, the implications of such observations are contextualized within the general discussion on the behaviour of the South-eastern Pyrenees Neanderthals.},

Fracture mechanics has the advantage of drawing more directly on first principles derived from physics and material sciences, but its relevance to controlled experimentation, replication and lithic studies more generally has been limited. Controlled experiments have the advantage of being able to isolate and quantify the contribution of individual variables to knapping outcomes, and the results of these experiments have provided models of flake formation that when applied to the archaeological record of flintknapping have provided insights into past behavior. Here we develop a linkage between fracture mechanics and the results of previous controlled experiments to increase their combined explanatory and predictive power. We do this by documenting the influence of Herztian cone formation, a constant in fracture mechanics, on flake platforms. We find that the platform width is a function of the Hertzian cone constant angle and the geometry of the platform edge. This finding strengthens the foundation of one of the more influential models emerging from the controlled experiments. With additional work, this should make it possible to merge more of the experimental results into a more comprehensive model of flake formation.},

            Prehistoric stone tools are an important source of evidence for the study of human behavioural and cognitive evolution. Archaeologists use insights from the experimental replication of lithics to understand phenomena such as the behaviours and cognitive capacities required to manufacture them. However, such experiments can require large amounts of time and raw materials, and achieving sufficient control of key variables can be difficult. A computer program able to accurately simulate stone tool production would make lithic experimentation faster, more accessible, reproducible, less biased, and may lead to reliable insights into the factors that structure the archaeological record. We present here a proof of concept for a machine learning-based virtual knapping framework capable of quickly and accurately predicting flake removals from 3D cores using a conditional adversarial neural network ({CGAN}). We programmatically generated a testing dataset of standardised 3D cores with flakes knapped from them. After training, the {CGAN} accurately predicted the length, volume, width, and shape of these flake removals using the intact core surface information alone. This demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning for investigating lithic production virtually. With a larger training sample and validation against archaeological data, virtual knapping could enable fast, cheap, and highly-reproducible virtual lithic experimentation.},

Here we use digital-image-analysis techniques to investigate the intensity of reduction in single-platform cores of the Developed Oldowan of the Okote Member, Koobi Fora Formation. Data suggest that this method provides a more accurate measure of reduction intensity than previous applications of a unifacial-scraper model. Assemblages of single-platform cores excavated from extensive lateral exposures of the Okote Member provide insights into the relationship between raw-material availability and discard patterns. Variation in reduction intensity suggests that tools are not always discarded in patterns that would be predicted by the availability of raw material. Further, it appears that hominin transport decisions involved an assessment of the potential use-life of certain forms. Many aspects of Developed Oldowan technology conform to previously developed models of curated technologies.},
